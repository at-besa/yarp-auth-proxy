# Proof of Concept for an Auth Gateway

_... aka Auth Reverse Proxy ... aka Backend for Frontend (BFF) ..._

## Features

- ‚òëÔ∏è Easily implementing Authentication, Authorization, and SSO for SPAs (e. g. Angular) by making this gateway taking care of the heavy lifting on the serve side
  
- ‚òëÔ∏è Tokens (id_token, access_token, refresh_token) are only stored on server-side in order to increase security

- ‚òëÔ∏è Opaque handling of XSRF tokens. Angular apps will use them automatically.

- ‚òëÔ∏è ``login``, ``logout``, and ``userinfo`` endpoints for SPA

- ‚òëÔ∏è Lots of further features by leveraging Microsoft's YARP Reverse Proxy (e. g. Loading Balancing, Health Checks, Distributed Tracing)

- ‚òëÔ∏è Configuration via ``appsettings.json``
  
## üî•‚ö°Ô∏è Running the Example

This example shown a reverse proxy orchestrating a SPA with a RESTful API (resource server) and a OAuth2/OIDC authorization server.

1. Get [.NET 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0) for Windows, Linux, or Mac
2. Call ``dotnet restore`` in the project's root to download all libs
3. Call ``dotnet run`` in the project's root to start the reverse proxy
4. Call the Demo App via http://localhost:8080

Also, have a look into the ``appsettings.json``.
